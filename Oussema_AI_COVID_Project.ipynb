    "Random undersampling deletes examples from the majority class and can result in losing information invaluable to a model.This has the effect of reducing the number of examples in the majority class in the transformed version of the training dataset. This process can be repeated until the desired class distribution is achieved, such as an equal number of examples for each class. So the predicted result will be more accurate if it is from the majority side."

    "Predicting The Missing Values\n",
    "Using the features which do not have missing values, we can predict the nulls with the help of a machine learning algorithm. This method may result in better accuracy, unless a missing value is expected to have a very high variance. We will be using linear regression to replace the nulls in the feature ‘age’, using other available features. One can experiment with different algorithms and check which gives the best accuracy instead of sticking to a single algorithm."
